# AI Assistance Log

This file documents how AI tools were used in the development of this project.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

## Where AI Helped
1. **Code explanations and debugging**
    - Asked ChatGPT to explain Java concepts (e.g., comparators, optionals, static vs non-static methods).
    - Used AI suggestions to identify bugs in my comparator and command execution logic.
2. **Refactoring & style**
    - Received suggestions to improve SLAP (single level of abstraction principle) by reducing nested `if` statements.
    - Used AI for ideas on how to restructure methods into helper functions and inner classes.
3. **Documentation & Git**
    - Asked ChatGPT for commit message templates following CS2103T conventions.
    - Drafted the initial structure for the User Guide (`README.md`) using AI as a starting point.
4. **Testing**
    - Used AI to generate sample JUnit test cases for parsing and storage edge cases.

## My Verification
- All AI-suggested code was **reviewed and edited** before adding to the repo.
- Verified correctness with manual testing and JUnit tests.
- Ensured code style, naming conventions, and design remained consistent with course requirements.

## Prompts (Summaries)
- “Explain how to use `Optional<LocalDate>` in a comparator.”
- “Generate an inner class that implements `Comparator<TaskItem>`.”
- “Give me a commit message with subject and body for implementing sort feature.”

## Attribution
AI tools were used as **assistants** (suggestions, drafts, explanations).  
Final decisions, code edits, and verification were done by me.
